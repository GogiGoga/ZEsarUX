Version 5.0. 21 April 2017 - Chase H.Q. edition

Finally I have succeded emulating Sinclair QL. I dedicated a lot of hours trying to guess how the keyboard work.
There is little documentation and I had to do lots of dissassemblies of the ROM and testing keyboard to know how it work...
So, hard work, this is a Quantum Leap, so this is a new major version, 5.0!
Complete changelog:

Added Sinclair QL emulation
Added remote command protocol. You can do enhanced debugging on ZEsarUX by using a telnet client. 
  There are a lot of commands, even many commands exclusive to this protocol and not found on the GUI, like:

* hexdump-internal
* set-register
